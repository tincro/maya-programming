# maya-programming
This is a collection of scripts that I've written from learning from various resources

The purpose of this study is to better understand Python and how I can use it to work with Maya and the Maya API

Resources that I've been using and give my ever-thankful appreciation:
<ul>
  <li><em>Maya Python for Games and Film by Adam Mechtley and Ryan Trowbridge</em>
</li>
  <li><em>Artist Friendly Maya Programming by Druv Govil</em>
</li>
  <li><em>Advanced Maya Programming by Druv Govil</em>

</ul>
