# maya-programming
This is a collection of scripts that I've written from learning from various resources

The purpose of this study is to better understand Python and how I can use it to work with Maya and the Maya API

Resources that I've been using:
Maya Python for Games and Film by Adam Mechtley and Ryan Trowbridge

Artist Friendly Maya Programming by Druv Govil
Advanced Maya Programming by Druv Govil
